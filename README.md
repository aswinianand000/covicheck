## DGIN_COVID_DETECTION
#### Project done as part of Digital Transformation Course

The COVID 19 pandemic has been wreaking havoc on the world for more than two years. Many people have been personally touched, including two of us in the group who have had first-hand experience. We've also been in a state of emotional anguish as we've seen our loved ones fight for their lives in ICUs. It was then that we recognized how much pressure our hospital systems were under to provide accurate and rapid diagnosis. There were extensive wait periods for lab findings and slow responses from medical personnel, particularly from the radiology department in evaluating X-rays and pathology laboratories for RT PCR testing, which are two of the most important instruments for detecting COVID 19. This is what prompted us to propose a framework for employing deep learning approaches to detect COVID 19 from X-ray images.

#### Objectives:
To develop a web application where chest X-ray images are fed into the web application and it would render back the results to the user helping in Covid-19 detection.

#### Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database
A group of researchers from Qatar University in Doha, Qatar, and the University of Dhaka in Bangladesh, along with collaborators from Pakistan and Malaysia, have created a database of chest X-ray images for COVID-19 positive cases, as well as Normal and Viral Pneumonia images, in collaboration with medical doctors.
